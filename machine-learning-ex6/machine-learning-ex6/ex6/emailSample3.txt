Alan, from reading the entire thread it appears that our reseller partner, POSData, is the one requesting 
the RFID SME support.    There may be a solution play but to get that readout you would need to request 
a call with FP&L directly and more fully qualify the opportunity.   If we don’t have direct access to their 
Innovation team and the larger scope of the project than we shouldn’t proceed from a Solutions 
perspective.   My two cents.

Chad

I should NOT have mentioned Smartlens… LOL
I told them about Smartlens, but this is a POC driven by FP&L’s Technology Cost Center. They already 
have the FR piece in place. All they need is the RFID equipment and some air cover.

Hi Arnie,
We want to engage our CEM that supports RFID/Smartlens to help us formulate the requirements and 
scope and then we can engage Sue to assist us in validating the design and applying any best practices 
that we may have overlooked.

Alan and Glen – Who should we engage here with Marty moving over to Lowe’s? Is Tim Fox the new 
dude for these engagements? If so, is he up to speed yet?
Can you guys help us identify the right people to help us discover and scope as well as set up an initial 
call with the account team to review?

Thanks.

                            With Regard,
 
Kent Foster

Hi Susan,

FP&L is in the process of testing our FX RFID readers / antennas in their PMK equipment trailers. Per the 
email below, they are asking us for guidance on best practices and placements for the RFID readers for 
optimization in this type of environment. This can be done over the phone. 
The opportunity consists of 50 trailers that would be equipped with RFID and facial recognition 
infrastructure to identify both the equipment and the person removing the equipment. FP&L will supply 
the facial recognition portion. I f all goes as planned, they would extend this to their 20 warehouses. 
Think of it as a variation of “SmartLens” where we would provide the RFID portion of the solution. The 
project is driven by FP&L’s IT Innovation Team. 
They are also looking at Impinj and other manufacturers. 
At this time, they’re only looking for the RFID equipment to accurately read all the tags in the pilot 
trailer. Please review the pictures below.
Who should we engage for support next week? I’m copying Brian who is our SE supporting this 
opportunity. We need someone to provide on line support between Wednesday and Thursday of next 
week.

SF Opportunity Number: Z-0000615354

Arnie,

Tom is on the road today and urgently needs your assistance and support on this project.  He needs an 
RFID SME assigned to this project ASAP and discussions need to be had.  

Tom has been informed that the PMK Trailer is being delivered to Juno Beach tomorrow (Thursday) and 
they need input from Zebra’s RFID SME for optimization on the FX7500 and AN480-CL66100WR 
antenna.  

Tom is going to be onsite next week Wednesday or Thursday for a project status check.  He is hoping by 
then we can have the SME loop in on a phone call and share the best practices and placements for the 
RFID readers for optimization in this type of environment.

PMK Trailer:                                                                                                                       Connex 
Trailer:                                                                                                                                                                               
                  
                 
 



Inside the Trailer:                                                                            Totes:

Tom will be in meetings today, but you can call his cell phone to discuss and leave message if necessary.

Thank you for your support on this project.
